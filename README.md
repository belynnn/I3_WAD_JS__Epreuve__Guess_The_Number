JavaScript final trial for the Web Application Developer training course, by Interface3. The main goal was to code a client-side application. 

You can try it here ðŸ‘‰ https://belynnn.github.io/I3_WAD_JS__guess_the_number/

## ðŸ”¹ Javascript final trial
In this project, you will create an interactive number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim of the game is to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in less than 10 attempts. The player will receive hints after each attempt as to whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

#### ðŸ”¹ Game functionality:
1. Generation of a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Management of user attempts with hint messages.
3. Displays a table summarising previous attempts.
4. Values are highlighted when they are within 5 of the value to be guessed.
5. Ends the game when the number has been guessed or when all the attempts have been made.

#### ðŸ”¹ Instructions
1. HTML
    - Structure the page with a section for the game and a section for the attempts summary.
